**Learning the Value of Education in the Dominican Republic (AVE-RD)** is a pilot project of public policy that seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of an information campaign in deciding the number of years of schooling of Dominican students.

AVE-RD is implemented by the Orientation and Psychology Department of the Ministry of Education of the Dominican Republic (MINERD) and evaluated by the Dominican Institute for Evaluation and Research of Educational Quality (IDEICE), and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty research center Action Lab (J-PAL). The project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the MINERD.

The program consists of showing videos about the value of education, in series TV format, to students between 7th and 12th grade.

The videos emphasize the value of education, and there were two variations:

  * **Informative**
  * **Persuasive**

The goal of the program is to reduce information gaps with respect to the benefits of receiving more education. This will only be effective to the extent that such a gap exists.

Preliminary results indicate that students tend to undervalue the benefit of more education, while over-valuing the benefit of having less education.

##### **Implementation of the Program**

  * The program was implemented in two batches: May 2015 and April 2016.
  * All schools that participated in the 2015 batch again did so in 2016

##### **Implementation Logistics**

  * AVE-RD videos were viewed by more than 200,000 students from the Dominican Republic between 2015 and 2016.
  * The AVE-RD project has collected more than 300,000 surveys, including information on students, teachers and parents.
  * As a logistical challenge, the AVE-RD project has mobilized more than 2,700 officials who have collaborated in different stages of the project, especially by the Department of Orientation and Psychology.
  * The AVE-RD project has trained hundreds of people in modern methods of fieldwork, call center and logistics.

##### **Effects**

  * Students affected by the program report less willingness to leave school to work, more likely to graduate from high school, and a better chance of obtaining a college degree.
  * The program had a significant effect on reducing the school dropout rate of students of varying degrees.
  * There are significant effects on increasing the average National Test scores of the students who were treated by the program.
  * The results suggest that behavioral change is driven not only by higher returns but by other aspects of the value of education.
